# This is my fith challenge from FrontendMentor.io

- In this project  I used only HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript.
- I took this challenge just to show my skills. It might has some errors but Im still learning and I will improve.
- In this project I used the URL shortener API from "https://shrtco.de/".
- The whole concept of the page is to put an URL in the input field and then the API will shorten it. 
- It is responsive made mobile first. 
- You can visualize this page at: " shrtco.de/mBNehX "
